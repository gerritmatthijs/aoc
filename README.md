# Advent of code in kotlin

Repo for the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/), written in kotlin. I try to make my solutions somewhat readable.

If you're unfamiliar with kotlin, you might want to read up on [trailing lambda's and it notation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/lambdas.html#passing-trailing-lambdas). Some other topics that might be helpful to read up on are:
* [null safety, with the safe call (?.) and Elvis (?:) operators](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/null-safety.html)
* [scope functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/scope-functions.html)
* [extension functions and properties](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html)
* [implicit this](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/this-expressions.html#implicit-this)
